          <h3>Mechanic and Sales Associate | 2017- Present</h3>
          <p>   After holding the possition as Service Manager at my last job, I decided that being "just" a mechanic, was a welcomed changed. Less stress ment more time to focus on the job at hand and that job was doing my part in keeping the shop running and orginized withought having to deal with meetings and budgeting. Not that I dont enjoy having responsibilities. Its just a nice break to be working on bikes nore than admin. We bounce around a ton at the shop. Its not unheard of to find me out on the sales floor talking to people about potential bike purchuses.

          <h3>Service Manager | 2017-2018</h3>
          <p>   I spent under a year working for Penn. First at their Richfield loction where I was hired then quickly relocated to Minneapolis to be the service manager. What seemed like a good fit at first drastically changed as the summer came on and bike season was in full swing. Personalities started to conflict and I decided that it was in my best interest to move on. During the time I was there I was incharge of scheduling and training mechanics along with ordering and stocking parts and tools for the shop all while proforming everyday repairs.
