        <p><h3> I have spent the better part of a decade fine tuning my skills as a bike mechanic. From my careers humble beginning volunteering as a mechanic at a local D.I.Y. community run bike collective to pro level wheel building at HED Cycling Products. I continually find ways to grow and learn by keeping up with the technologies both new and old. My life has been devoured by bikes. When I am not working on them I am usually training on my bike or preparing for a race. My main discipline is track raceing and if you have never seen it, you should, it is a sight to behold. I have been vary dedicated to the path I have choosen and look forward to what my future may hold.</h3></p>

          <p><h3>  After holding the position as Service Manager at my last job, I decided that being "just" a mechanic, was a welcomed change. Less stress meant more time to focus on the job at hand and that job was doing my part in keeping the shop running and organized with out having to deal with meetings and budgeting. Not that I don't enjoy having responsibilities, it's just a nice break to be working on bikes more than admin. We bounce around a ton at the shop. It's not unheard of to find me out on the sales floor talking to people about potential bike purchases.

          <p><h3> I spent under a year working for Penn. First at their Richfield location where I was hired then quickly relocated to Minneapolis to be the service manager. What seemed like a good fit at first drastically changed as the summer came on and bike season was in full swing. Personalities started to conflict, and I decided that it was in my best interest to move on. During the time I was there I was in charge of scheduling and training mechanics along with ordering and stocking parts and tools for the shop all while performing everyday repairs.</h3></p>
