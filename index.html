          <h3>Mechanic and Sales Associate | 2017- Present</h3>
          <p> After holding the possition as Service Manager at my last job, I decided that being "just" a mechanic, was a welcomed changed. Less stress ment more time to focus on the job at hand and that job was doing my part in keeping the shop running and orginized withought having to deal with meetings and budgeting. Not that I dont enjoy having responsibilities. Its just a nice break to be working on bikes nore than admin. We bounce around a ton at the shop. Its not unheard of to find me out on the sales floor talking to people about potential bike purchuses.
